It was a separate sighting and the cub was fast asleep. T19 was as usual acting like super mom searching for food and was about to attack a spotted deer but gave up as the deer was not within its attack radius..
The second park round was supposed to be more fruitful since it was in the morning. We were in Gypsies, a group of 6 persons per Gypsy, so less noise and a smoother drive aided in optimum eye level photography. We were allotted Zone No. 1 which is supposed to be good and area of Noor and her 2 male cubs. We drove looking for birds and other things. Suddenly i noticed something and I asked the driver to stop the car - It was  a Striped Hyena - one of the rare / uncommon sightings and even odd for that particular time in the morning. Our guide / driver was losing his cool & was showing signs of being irritated as we were stopping for each and every bird and for so called ""common"" things. Suddenly we heard an alarm call of Spotted Deer as well as Hanuman Langurs. We stopped and waited for a few minutes.However, the alarm call diminished soon and the reason could have been a male tiger /tigress who could have been sitting camouflaged by the tall grass. We drove further ahead and after some time we saw a bunch of gypsies standing near a rock wall. A cub was sitting on the cliff and watching us curiously. This was the junior cub of Noor ( we came to know about this eventually).... we parked our jeep and started shooting the ""Male"" cub, the fellow Jeep members whispered that there is another tiger cub behind the rock wall. This funny cub was running behind the Painted Spurfowl or the Langurs above. This was a ""poser"" male cub and was giving fantastic poses and with lots of facial expressions. Suddenly he vanished behind the rock and we all were disappointed.....but just after a gap of 5 minutes he re-appeared and sat on the top of the rock facing other side. Soon the second cub appeared and sat just in front of his brother but we could see only his ears and some portion of his head..
Soon this ""cartoon"" cub started running for the passing Hanuman Langurs and just appeared in front of our Jeep. We captured hundreds of his antics on camera . Somehow we were dreaming for the second cub to come forwards and sit next to his brother so that we can click ""The Two Brothers"" together. But the cub behind was not at all in the mood to move from his position. All of a sudden the first cub was very curious and watching intently behind our jeep. We were thinking that it must be his mommy returning to the cubs. This fellow was making funny faces but highly aware of his surroundings. We were also curious why the cub was so restless and alert. Soon he got up and started to climb on to the rock... which was just above us! and if by chance he jumped from there, he would have landed directly on our jeep! We all sat quietly and observed carefully.... carefully as he might jump on us but at the same time with the hope that we may get some good shots. Somehow one of the tourists in the back jeep saw a spotted  female deer approaching the lake next to our jeep. Now we all realised that ""this "" is the thing for which the cub was so restless and active. This was a learning curve for me ... that how a small cub (about 14/16 months old) can smell a prey from such a long distance. He started stalking on the rock itself..... but he was on the high rock at the right side... then down on the road we are in 3/4 jeeps... and then at the left side of our jeep (road) there was a small lake where the Spotted Deer was approaching for water. The cub started making faces and showed his hyperactive side. The deer approached slowly towards the water...now the second male also smelled the ""prey"" and stood up on the spot. The poor deer was unaware about the danger that awaited them at the paws of the two mighty predators. The deer started drinking water slowly... the second cub came forward and now he  was on the edge of the rock. The rock was approx 12/15 feet tall. He took some time and then he started crouching and stalking......all were mesmerized and engrossed with the act. Many fellow photographers were lost in the scene and forgot about the photography and were simply enjoying the thrill. I was quite focused 
and glued to the 1.5 centimeter viewfinder and never left the viewfinder as i wanted to catch the drama. Of course there were 5 jeeps in front of us so I was aware that we might miss the ""hunt""but I was hoping for the best and concentrated on my ""viewfinder"" only though it was my maiden attempt to capture the kill in front of me. At that point of time my whole life was concentrated in that 1.5 cm viewfinder and of course for that Spotted Deer. Within a fraction of a second the second cub leaped from the rock and crossed the road in front of the jeeps and chased the deer. The deer sensed the danger and started running away helter skelter... but the cub was too fast and powerful and he smacked him with his mighty paw... the deer was thrown away just like a football... but the cub pounced on him again and pressed the deer on the ground and just sat there for many minutes.... just like a winner with the trophy... it might be his first ever individual hunt without the help of mother ""Noor"". The first cub, which also ran behind the deer as a backup plan, calmly went away and sat a few feet away from the kill and the trophy winning brother.... may be a tad upset as he missed his ""kill"". As the kill was pressed in the ground and was not visible due to a log and some bushes in front, we missed the feasting shots. We were only able to click pictures of the cub with his face painted in the deer's blood whenever he grasped the leg, neck and lifted the kill.

Our first Tiger safari through Ranthambore gave us a beautiful morning introduction to the great national park, but no Tiger. Our second safari, in the afternoon, was a bit tenser. With one chance down, we did not want to miss the big cat. 

Increasing the odds, our guide had good information on where a Tiger had been seen earlier in the day. We proceeded quickly to the area, slowed down, and began carefully scanning through the dry forest. A Sambar deer started to sound its loud barking alarm call, indicating a Tiger was near, and our search efforts ratcheted up to the next level.

Then there it was, the fantastic goal of our quest. It was well hidden, we could have driven by it, but our systematic searching paid off. We enjoyed its company alone for a few minutes, and then as word spread more safari jeeps and trucks began to arrive. Soon there were perhaps 100 people sharing the moment.

I like the photo above, it gives a real sense of the animal in its habitat. While not a classic full on view, it is better than what most of the other visitors saw. Shortly after this image was secured the Tiger rolled over and went to sleep, giving folks an orange stripy ball to look at and not much else.",5,0,false,,"Rajasthan, IN",25.8814259724,76.4794909177,9096,,,,29913,,obscured,true,,,Rajasthan,India,Bengal Tiger,Panthera tigris tigris,Bengal Tiger,Mammalia,130793
